#### Scenario:
# Primate habitats are often fragmented due to anthropogenic pressures
# such as deforestation and land-use change. Researchers are interested
# in understanding how habitat type (primary vs. secondary forest) and
# temperature influence the daily travel distance of primates,
# and whether the effect of temperature on travel distance differs
# between habitat types due to differing food distributions and tree cover.

## Two-level factor: habitat ("Primary" and "Secondary")
## Continuous predictor: meanDailyTemp_C (mean daily temperature in Celsius)
## Response variable: meanDailyDistance_km (mean daily travel distance in kilometers)

#### Question: How does temperature and habitat affect travel distance, 
#### and do monkeys in Primary and Secondary forests respond differently
#### to changes in mean daily temperature in terms of their daily travel distance?
